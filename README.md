# OCNS22-nest_compartmental_tutorial

The files compartmental_tutorial_empty and compartmental_tutorial_solution discuss model creation, dendritic computation, and networks of compartmental neurons. The first two section were adapted from the original which is nest_compartmental_tutorial. I adapted the tutorial to be more interactive such that participants need to add sections to the code. However I suggest we make both the empty and the solution file available such that participants can skip sections.
